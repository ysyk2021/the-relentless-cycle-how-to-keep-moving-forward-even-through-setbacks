Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present and engaged in the current moment, without judgment or attachment to thoughts, feelings, or outcomes. It involves intentionally directing your focus to the present moment, acknowledging and accepting your current experiences, and cultivating a non-reactive awareness.

Meditation is a formal practice that cultivates mindfulness and helps train the mind to remain focused and calm. It typically involves finding a quiet and comfortable space, adopting a specific posture, and engaging in a variety of techniques such as focusing on the breath, visualizations, or repeating mantras.
